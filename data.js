      "It doesn’t matter how hard you work, if your attitude is bad, you won’t get very far. It’s important to show that you care about your work and that you are willing to go the distance to get the job done. A good way to keep a positive attitude is to work on projects that are interesting to you. It sounds obvious, but many people will agree to roles they have no interest in. Playing it safe wont make you a great developer!"

I’ve answered a question about this on Quora which you may want to take a look at. Always follow coding standards and write code that is understandable and commented where necessary and can be passed on to someone else easily. This was always important but in the remote age, it’s essential."

      "Good communication skills directly correlate with good development skills. The ability to communicate is crucial for understanding problems clearly, being able to break them down into hypotheses and propose solutions in a coherent manner. You should be able to learn concepts quickly. And yes this is a skill that improves through practice. If English is not your first language, make sure you know it well and can communicate it effectively. In the world of technology, English is the de facto language of most documentation and developer interactions. If you don’t speak it well enough, interpreters or translators may be required, making your knowledge second hand and easily outdated."

      "As much as specific skill expertise is important, it shouldn’t be the single factor you focus on.A great [insert any skill here] developer is not necessarily a great developer. It’s the addition of the soft skills above that make them great. The ability to learn quickly and jump into a project seamlessly, to help others out, to always have a great attitude. These are the skills that make you invaluable to a business. Consider implementing some (or all!) of these characteristics, and you can easily become a good (if not great) programmer much faster. Even within a year, but it depends on how much work you do in that year of course!"
