It’s important to show that you care about your work and that you are willing to go the distance to get the job done. A good way to keep a positive attitude is to work on projects that are interesting to you. It sounds obvious, but many people will agree to roles they have no interest in. Playing it safe wont make you a great developer!",

The ability to communicate is crucial for understanding problems clearly, being able to break them down into hypotheses and propose solutions in a coherent manner. You should be able to learn concepts quickly. And yes this is a skill that improves through practice. If English is not your first language, make sure you know it well and can communicate it effectively. In the world of technology, English is the de facto language of most documentation and developer interactions. If you don’t speak it well enough, interpreters or translators may be required, making your knowledge second hand and easily outdated.",

These are the skills that make you invaluable to a business. Consider implementing some (or all!) of these characteristics, and you can easily become a good (if not great) programmer much faster.
